                <p>
                    <strong>Beginner</strong><br>
                    If you've been on a hiatus from working out, I recommend starting at beginner. Don't worry though, this will help you ease back into fitness without pulling a muscle or any other sort of injury.

                <p>
                    <strong>Intermediate</strong><br>
                    If you've been exercising regularly in the past 1-3 months, I recommend starting at intermediate. This level will help build your muscle and get you into the habit of working out on a regular basis.

                    <strong>Advanced</strong><br>
                    If you've been exercising regularly for the past 3-6+ months, I recommend starting at advanced. You may alreday know a lot of the information I provide. However, I encourage you to try something new!
