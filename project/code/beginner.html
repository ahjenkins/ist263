                Welcome! I’m so glad you’re here to learn something new. Whatever fitness background you come to this page with, I promise that you will take something away from it that will transform you into a better version of yourself. All you need is a space to move around in such as a gym, field, or park, and a passion to grow and improve!

                We can begin by doing some dynamic stretching movements that will warm up your body before you start exercising. This will decrease the chance of injury and muscle strain. If you don't know how to do any of the stretches listed, feel free to look up images or videos of a person performing the movement.

                We're going to start with full body bodyweight exercises and then build our way up to machines, free weights, and barbells in the more advanced pages. If you do not know how to do an exercise, search the Internet for pictures or videos on how to do them. There are also modified versions for many of the exercises.

            <p>
                As a beginner, I encourage you to commit 30 minutes-1 hour for 3 days a week. You can choose whichever 3 days that work for your schedule. Each day you work out, you want to incorporate exercises from each column of muscle groups. I suggest completing all exercises in 2 consecutive rows to make it easy on you. For each exercise, you work for 1 minute and rest for 1 minute.<br>
                A sample schedule is provided for you below.
            </p>
            <img src="../media/beginner_sample.png" alt="Beginner Sample Schedule">
            <p>
                To <strong>increase</strong> the <strong>intensity</strong> of the workout, increase the work time or decrease the rest time. To <strong>decrease</strong> the <strong>intensity</strong> of the workout, decrease the work time or increase the rest time. If you want to increase both, I suggest you move to the Intermediate page!<br>
                Remember that it's okay to not be perfect in your first few workouts. We all get tired and have a lot that runs through our minds while we work out. Stay focused, finish out the exercise, and improve your technique every rep.

                When you complete your workout, it's important that you stretch again. This time, it's okay to incorporate static stretching because your muscles are warm.<br>
                Consider these stretches:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Touching your toes</li>
                <li>Quad stretch</li>
                <li>Lunge stretch hold</li>
                <li>Groin stretch</li>
                <li>Calf stretch</li>
                <li>Hip flexor stretch</li>
                <li>Chest stretch</li>
                <li>Overhead triceps stretch</li>
                <li>Bicep stretch</li>
                <li>Shoulder stretch</li>
            </ol>
