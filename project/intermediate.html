                The 5-day split is a well-rounded schedule that will help build muscle and increase strenght in target muscle groups of your body.<br>
                Five days of exercise means two full days of rest. Use the rest days to recover your body and prepare it for the next workout. You can choose whichever days you want to work out. I recommend coupling upper and lower body on back-to-back days and then grouping push, pull, and legs on consecutive days. The rest days can be back-to-back, or you can separate them in between the 2 different groups I just mentioned. Feel free to do whatever works for you.<br>
                A sample schedule is provided for you below.
            </p>
            <img src="media/intermediate_sample.png" alt="Intermediate Sample Schedule">
            <p>
                This is a simple and standard workout of <strong>3 sets of 12 reps</strong> for each exercise. Rep is short for repition, and it represents the number of times you complete an exercise. The number of reps you aim to complete at once is called a set.<br>
                A good range o 6 to 15 reps will increase <strong>hypertrophy</strong>. One to five reps will increase <strong>strength</strong>, and more than 15 reps will increase <strong>endurance</strong>. <strong>Rest</strong> times will vary as well. For hypertrophy, anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes is sufficient. For strength, 3-5 minutes is a good amount of time to recover. For endurance, 20-90 seconds will help you push your limits.<br>
                In your first few workouts, you will be experimenting with the amount of weight you want to lift. Start small and add increments of about 2.5-5 pounds over the course of several weeks to progress your lifts. It's better to start with lighter weight and perform more reps than start with heavier weight and perform fewer reps.
