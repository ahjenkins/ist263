    Hi, my name is Anna Jenkins. I am studying Information Management & Technology at Syracuse University, and I am interested in collaborating with other students to create and build technology platforms that will inspire others and provide cool learning opportunities and experiences. I have skills in social media marketing, research writing, Google suite, time management, and teamwork. When I am not doing schoolwork, you can find me in the gym working out or playing soccer, hanging out with my family and friends, or listening to music (all kinds!). I love to constantly be learning and trying new things to challenge myself.
